___Project for the Multisensory Interactive Systems course at UNITN___

### Introduction ###

Getting into music can sometimes be challenging, and especially at the beginning when players have to become familiar with basic musical principles, the training can be boring and discourage people making them lose interest into the activity. 
 
Here comes the idea of a system which can introduce basic concepts like tempo or simple sound effects in a game-like experience for two people. What makes this project unique is the idea of combining two different interfaces, one for audio and one for video, which are operated by one player each. Only by being focused into the music and by paying attention to the changes in both sound and video, the two players can experience the best results. The evaluations seem to indicate that players, especially non-musicians, benefit from the game-like experience to improve their awareness of their performance with the music synthesizer.

### Files and folders: ###
